We take a grid of boxes
Scale up en object by "some factor" (can it be just 2?)
    In reality, we can scale down the grid, make more boxes

For circle:
Number of touched boxes should rize by square of scaling factor

Yes, scaling by 2 is good, the scaling factor can be random,
so c=2 will give us consistent and easy to implement factor

When we get a number of boxes touched for every scaling factor,
and find the average tendency, we should get sth like:
    boxes touched = c * x^sth

    Where x = scaling factor
    <sth> = fractal dimension
Now, wtf is c?
Apparently, c is "some constant"

CS approach:
N = Number of boxes touched
c = some constant
s = scaling factor
dim = fractal dimension, what we are looking for

Now: log(N) = log(c) + dim * log(s)

The point is, if we count log(N) for every log(s),
we get a linear tendency
Surprise: this tendency is a line with slope = dim !!!

I think i might go from maximum box resolution to bigger and bigger
boxes, it will allow me to solve this problem with a nice bruteforce
